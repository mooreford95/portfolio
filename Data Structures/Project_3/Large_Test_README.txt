This directory contains the following files

g5_tests.in - all possible commands on any graph of five vertices named alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon

The following five-vertex graphs are tested using g5_tests.in; in each case the graph is in the .txt file, the expected output in the .out file; so an x.out file was generated using

$ java SocialNetwork x.txt < g5_tests.in > x.out

k5.txt, k5.out - complete graph on five vertices

n5.txt, n5.out - five vertices, no edges

p5.txt, p5.out - a path of five vertices

p_2_2_1.txt, p_2_2_1.out - five vertices, two edges, three components

The remaining test cases are large random graphs paired with long sequences of random commands. We will run these to make sure your graph structure and your algorithms are reasonably efficient. Timing results from my solution are in large_test_execution.txt.

n_x_y.txt is a graph with x vertices and roughly y edges

c_x_y.in is a sequence of y random commands, mostly roughly 1/3 each of isfriend, mutual, and relation, with an occasional notconnected or popular thrown in; the vertex names in these commands match those of n_x_y.txt

c_x_y.out is the expected output generated by
$ java SocialNetwork n_x_y.txt < c_x_y.in > c_x_y.out
