These files are test cases based on two graphs: simple-graph.txt and boundary-graph.txt.

To test your program, compile it, and do

$ java simple-graph.txt < simple.in > my-simple.out
$ diff simple.out my-simple.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < b1_isfriend.in > my-b1_isfriend.out
$ diff b1_isfriend.out my-b1_isfriend.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < b2_mutual.in > my-b2_mutual.out
$ diff b2_mutual.out my-b2_mutual.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < b3_relation.in > my-b3_relation.out
$ diff b3_relation.out my-b3_relation.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < b4_notconnected.in > my-b4_notconnected.out
$ diff b4_notconnected.out my-b4_notconnected.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < b5_popular.in > my-b5_popular.out
$ diff b5_popular.out my-b5_popular.out

$ java boundary-graph.txt < boundary_all.in > my-boundary_all.out
$ diff boundary_all.out my-boundary_all.out

You should not see any differences.
